Country finder is a mini web app which allows you to get basic information such as
population, language and currency of any country as typed in the search field. I built this using a public api on github.
I interacted with the api using old-fashioned AJAX XMLHttpRequest.
I might create another repo which will be a more refactored version using a more mordern way of calling the API. Also with some new features.
Here is the link to the hosted version: https://chulo-country.netlify.app/
